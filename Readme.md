# Exploring neural representations of spatial environments and navigation with artificial agents
Sandbox environment simulating cognitive maps with graphical neural networks and deep reinforcement learning to explore human-ai spatial learning and ecosystem collaboration.

# Intro
### Selecting landmark locations (place cells)

### Constructing cell activity patterns (grid cells)
We use sinusoidal interference to simulate hexagonal patterns in the brain (this is a 
simplified, supervised learning model of the brain's neural firing processes which are
naturally nondeterministic and unsupervised):
$$
f(x,y) = \sum_{i=1}^{3} \cos(k_i \cdot (x,y) + \phi_i)
$$

where:
- \((x,y)\) are the coordinates of the agent.
- \( k_i \) represents the frequency of neural firing.
- \( \phi_i \) is the phase shift/offset between waves, tracking shifts to create an optimal hexagonal representation that reduces redundancy.

three waves (representing equilateral triangles that form the hexagon shape) are spaced 120Â° apart to form a consistent hexagonal pattern.

# Getting started

# Dataset
Link: [Population Dynamics Embedding](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/veeralakrishna/population-dynamics-embeddings). Vector embeddings of locations based on human interactions.
- Polygon coordinates for boundaries
- Topological map of relationships between spaces
- Semantic labels for locations

### Future work
- Use lateral inhibition as opposed to inhibition to more accurately reflect impact of neural firing on neighboring neurons
- Use a Recurrent neural network to update parameters based on historical data instead of only
on current data
- Train an unsupervised model to learn grid cell patterns with introducing primed input
