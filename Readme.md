# Exploring neural representations of spatial environments and human-ecosystem collaboration
Sandbox environment simulating cognitive maps with graphical neural networks to explore human-ai spatial learning and ecosystem collaboration.

# Intro

# Getting started

# Dataset
Link: [Population Dynamics Embedding](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/veeralakrishna/population-dynamics-embeddings). Vector embeddings of locations based on human interactions.
- Polygon coordinates for boundaries
- Topological map of relationships between spaces
- Semantic labels for locations
